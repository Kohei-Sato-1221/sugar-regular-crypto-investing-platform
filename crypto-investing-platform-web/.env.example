# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use ".env.example" to build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo.
# Keep this file up-to-date when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any secrets in it.
# If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.js" should be updated accordingly.

# Example: DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/dbname?schema=public"
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/crypto-investing-platform?schema=public"
